## Note: Why my commits aren't signed anymore
Well, you may have noticed that some of my commits don't show the really nice "Verified" green badge. The reason for that is because all of a sudden GPG decided to stop signing and giving the prompt, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. Unfortunately, I have to stop signing my commits. But now I can use the VSCode Git UI! At least one good thing came out of it.
